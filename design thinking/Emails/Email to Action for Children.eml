Hello,



I'm writing to ask whether I can send you some surveys to get opinions from children in your care and staff in your establishments. I'm a student in my final year of studying for my undergraduate degree, which is a mixture of computer science and business classes. For my final project I am developing some software.



One of my lecturers suggested making something to help children in care with their education, since it's well documented (I did a lot of reading about this) that children looked after by local authorities frequently receive lower grades than children who are not looked after by local authorities. Therefore, I hope to create a website/application for children in care to speak to people (probably undergraduates, since they have generally recently finished compulsory eduction and have insight into curriculums and assessments for GCSEs and A-levels) who can help them with their homework and also provide general mentoring.



The surveys are short (they should take around 5 minutes to complete), anonymous and do not ask for any sensitive information. One survey is designed to get a sense of how children in care feel about their education and homework and what they think might help them to get better results. The other survey is for staff looking after children in care, designed to get a sense of what they think are the obstacles the children encounter in their education, what might help them to do better and also very importantly, what can be done to ensure appropriate safeguarding for children receiving tuition and mentoring through video calls.

Survey for staff: https://forms.gle/NWbC8BJEQ2vpHXjTA



Any number of completed surveys is useful to me, even if only one or two each of children and staff respond to these. This will really help me to finish my degree and if my project goes well, will contribute to creation of a service which could help children in care to get better results from eduction in future. Thank you for your time and any responses are much appreciated.



Yours sincerely,

Ed Bradbury
